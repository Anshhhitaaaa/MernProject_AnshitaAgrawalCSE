# Server Error Fix Documentation

## Problem

Users were experiencing a "Server error" when attempting to log in from different devices, despite the API being accessible and CORS being configured to allow all origins (`*`).

## Root Cause

After investigation, we identified two main issues:

1. **CORS Configuration**: While the server was configured to allow all origins with `origin: '*'`, it was not properly configured to handle credentials (cookies, authorization headers, etc.) across origins.

2. **Fetch Requests**: The frontend API requests in `AuthContext.jsx` were not including the `credentials: 'include'` option, which is required when sending credentials (like cookies or authorization headers) across origins.

## Solution

We made the following changes to fix the issue:

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration in `server.js`

Changed from:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*', // Allow all origins
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```

To:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: true, // Allow requests from any origin with credentials
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true // Allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers, etc.)
}));
```

**Note**: When using `credentials: true`, the CORS specification requires that `origin` cannot be `'*'`. We changed it to `true` which allows the server to echo back the request origin, enabling credential sharing.

### 2. Updated API Requests in `AuthContext.jsx`

Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch requests:

- `/api/auth/me` (check login status)
- `/api/auth/register` (register user)
- `/api/auth/login` (login user)
- `/api/auth/updatedetails` (update profile)
- `/api/auth/updatepassword` (update password)

Example change:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/login`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  credentials: 'include', // Added this line
  body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
});
```

## Testing

We created a test page (`test-login.html`) to verify the API connectivity and CORS configuration. The test confirmed that:

1. The server is accessible from both localhost and the network IP address
2. The login API endpoint works correctly with the proper credentials
3. The CORS headers are properly configured to allow credentials

## Additional Notes

- The `credentials: 'include'` option tells the browser to include credentials (cookies, authorization headers) with the request, even for cross-origin requests.
- The server's `credentials: true` CORS option tells the browser that it's safe to send credentials to this server from other origins.
- These changes should allow users to log in from different devices on the same network without encountering the "Server error".

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Ensure you're using the correct network IP address in the `config.js` file
3. Check that both the frontend and backend servers are running
4. Verify that your browser supports and allows cross-origin credentials
